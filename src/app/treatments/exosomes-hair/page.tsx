  {
    question: "What is Exosomes Hair and how does it work?",
    answer: "Exosomes Hair is an advanced regenerative treatment that uses exosomes - tiny vesicles containing growth factors, proteins, and RNA - to stimulate hair follicles and promote hair growth. These exosomes are derived from stem cells and deliver cellular communication signals directly to hair follicles. When injected into the scalp, exosomes activate dormant follicles, extend the growth phase of the hair cycle, improve blood supply to follicles, and enhance overall hair quality, density, and thickness."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do Exosomes Hair results last?",
    answer: "Results vary depending on individual factors and treatment area. We'll discuss expected duration during your consultation."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Exosomes Hair treatment painful?",
    answer: "Most patients experience minimal discomfort. We use advanced techniques and can apply numbing agents if needed to ensure your comfort throughout the procedure."
  },
  {
    question: "When will I see results?",
    answer: "Results may be visible immediately or develop gradually over several weeks, depending on the treatment type. We'll provide a personalized timeline during consultation."
  },
  {
    question: "Who is a good candidate for Exosomes Hair?",
    answer: "Ideal candidates are adults experiencing hair loss, thinning hair, or seeking to improve hair density and quality. Exosomes Hair is suitable for both men and women and can be used for various types of hair loss including androgenetic alopecia, telogen effluvium, or general hair thinning. We'll assess your hair condition during consultation."
  },
  {
    question: "How many sessions are needed?",
    answer: "Most patients require 3-6 sessions, spaced 4-6 weeks apart, for optimal results. The exact number depends on the degree of hair loss, individual response, and treatment goals. Maintenance treatments may be needed every 6-12 months."
  },
  {
    question: "When will I see results?",
    answer: "Some patients notice improvements in hair quality and reduced shedding within 4-8 weeks. Visible hair growth typically appears after 8-12 weeks, with full results developing over 4-6 months as new hair grows and existing hair becomes thicker. Results continue to improve with each session."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Exosomes Hair treatment painful?",
    answer: "Most patients experience mild discomfort during the injection process, similar to other injectable treatments. We can apply numbing cream to ensure your comfort. The scalp injections are generally well-tolerated, and any discomfort is temporary."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any side effects?",
    answer: "Common side effects include mild redness, swelling, or tenderness at injection sites that typically resolve within a few hours. Some patients may experience minor bruising. Since exosomes are derived from stem cells and are biocompatible, there's minimal risk of allergic reactions. Serious side effects are rare."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Exosomes Hair differ from PRP?",
    answer: "Exosomes are more concentrated and potent than PRP. While PRP uses your own platelets and growth factors, exosomes contain a higher concentration of growth factors, proteins, and RNA that can more effectively stimulate hair follicles. Exosomes also provide cellular communication signals that PRP doesn't, potentially offering enhanced results."
  },
  {
    question: "Can Exosomes Hair be combined with other hair treatments?",
    answer: "Yes, Exosomes Hair can be combined with other treatments like minoxidil, finasteride, laser therapy, or hair transplant procedures for comprehensive hair restoration. We'll create a personalized treatment plan during your consultation."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do results last?",
    answer: "Results can last 12-18 months or longer, depending on individual factors and the underlying cause of hair loss. Maintenance treatments every 6-12 months can help maintain and enhance results. The new hair that grows is your natural hair, so results are long-lasting."

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Exosomes are derived from stem cells and prepared in a concentrated solution. The exosomes 
                  are injected into the scalp in areas experiencing hair loss or thinning. The injection 
                  process creates micro-injuries that trigger the body's natural healing response, while 
                  the exosomes deliver their regenerative payload directly to hair follicles.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Exosomes contain growth factors, proteins, and RNA that act as cellular communication 
                  signals. These signals are delivered directly to hair follicle cells, activating dormant 
                  follicles and enhancing the function of active follicles. The exosomes essentially 
                  "tell" the follicles to grow and function better.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  The growth factors and proteins in exosomes stimulate hair follicles in multiple ways: 
                  they increase blood supply to follicles, extend the growth phase (anagen) of the hair 
                  cycle, activate stem cells within follicles, and improve the overall health and function 
                  of hair-producing cells.

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-3">4. Progressive Hair Growth</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Over the following weeks and months, stimulated follicles begin producing new, stronger 
                  hair. Existing hair becomes thicker, and new hair growth appears. With multiple sessions, 
                  the cumulative effect leads to improved hair density, thickness, and overall hair quality. 
                  The enhanced cellular communication continues to support hair growth over time.
